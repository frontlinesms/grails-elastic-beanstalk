= AWS Elastic Beanstalk Grails Plugin documentation

== Introduction

The AWS Elastic Beanstalk Grails Plugin provides a set of Grails scripts for deploying a Grails application WAR to the AWS Elastic Beanstalk PaaS service.

== Quick Start

See the plugin link:./quick-start.html[Quick Start] guide.

== Installation

In +BuildConfig.groovy+ add the following plugin dependency to the +plugins+ section (with the latest version of the plugin specified):

[source,groovy]
----
plugins {
	build ':aws-elastic-beanstalk:0.3'	
}
----

== Plugin Configuration

=== Configuring AWS credentials

[options="header"]
|===
| Config type | Variable name | Comment |
| +Config.groovy+ | +grails.plugin.awsElasticBeanstalk.awsAccessKeyId+ +grails.plugin.awsElasticBeanstalk.awsAccessKeyId+ |
| System properties | +AWSAccessKeyId+ +AWSSecretKey+ |
| Environment variable | +AWS_CREDENTIAL_FILE+ | path to credentials file, compatible with AWS CLI tool |
|===

see: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/usingCLI.html

TK warning about storing AWS credentials
WARNING: secure this key!

TK sample config file here

	AWSAccessKeyId=
	AWSSecretKey=

=== Using a non-default AWS region

By default, the Elastic Beanstalk plugin uses the US-East (Northern Virginia) AWS Region (+us-east-1+). To use a different region, configure the AWS Elastic Beanstalk service endpoint using one of the endpoint URLs listed in the AWS reference docs:

http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#elasticbeanstalk_region

[options="header"]
|===
| Config type | Variable name | Comment |
| +Config.groovy+ | +grails.plugin.awsElasticBeanstalk.serviceEndpointUrl+ | |
| System property | +awsElasticBeanstalk.serviceEndpointUrl+ | |
| Environment variable | +ELASTICBEANSTALK_URL+ | compatible with AWS CLI tool |
|===

For example, to configure the plugin to use the Asia Pacific (Tokyo) Region, add the following to +Config.groovy+:

[source, groovy]
grails.plugin.awsElasticBeanstalk.serviceEndpointUrl = 'https://elasticbeanstalk.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com'


=== Configuring the target Elastic Beanstalk application and environment

NOTE: The application name must be between 4 and 23 characters long.

.Configuration options for Elastic Beanstalk application name
[options="header"]
|===
| Config type | Variable name | Comment |
| +Config.groovy+ | +grails.plugin.awsElasticBeanstalk.applicationName+ | |
| System property | +awsElasticBeanstalk.applicationName+ | |
| default | +appName+ | the value of Grails +appName+ is used by default if not otherwise specified |
|===

.Configuration options for Elastic Beanstalk environment name
[options="header"]
|===
| Config type | Variable name | Comment |
| +Config.groovy+ | +grails.plugin.awsElasticBeanstalk.environmentName+ | |
| System property | +awsElasticBeanstalk.environmentName+ | |
| default | appName | +"${appname}-default}" is used if not otherwise specified |
|===


== Using an Elastic Beanstalk saved configuration for new environments

When deploying a WAR, if the plugin finds that the target environment does not exist, it will create a new environment using a saved configuration, if specified.

.Configuration options for Elastic Beanstalk saved configuration name
[options="header"]
|===
| Config type | Variable name | Comment |
| +Config.groovy+ | +grails.plugin.awsElasticBeanstalk.savedConfigurationName+ | |
| System property | +awsElasticBeanstalk.savedConfigurationName+ | |
| default | +default+ | |
|===


==== Defaults

TK document default application/environment name

TK discuss default JVM settings / container settings


== Stopping an environment

The +aws-eb-stop+ command (alias for +aws-eb-terminate-environment+) will terminate all running instances for an environment and deleting the associated AWS resources.

TK link to AWS docs here

Unfortunately, Elastic Beanstalk does not currently provide any way to stop a running application without terminating all instances.

TK add warning callout here
If you have created other AWS resources tied to the Elastic Beanstalk environment (such as a CloudFront distribution), these may prevent the environment from terminating successfully and will need to be cleaned up separately.
